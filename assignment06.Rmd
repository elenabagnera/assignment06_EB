## Question 1

RMSE=
MAE=

Because if the squaring, RMSE penalizes large errors more than MSA does. 
```{r rmse}
knitr::include_graphics("image0 (1).jpeg")

```

## Question 2

```{r confusion}
knitr::include_graphics("image2.jpeg")
```


## Question 3

```{r multiclass}
knitr::include_graphics("image3.jpg")
```

## Question 4

*Consider a population where it is known that 0.49 of observations have a value of 0 and 0.51 of observations
have a value of 1. Approximately what accuracy can be achieved by simply guessing the same value for all
observations? What number should you predict?*

You would get a 51% accuracy if you guess 1 for all observations and 49 if you guess 0. What you want to predict depends on context. Even if guessing 1 leads to more accuracy, getting the observations that have a value of 0 may be very important (e.g. for targeting a program)

*Consider a population where it is known that 0.99 of observations have a value of 0 and 0.01 of observations
have a value of 1. Approximately what accuracy can be achieved by simply guessing the same value for all
observations? What number should you predict?*

You would get a 1% accuracy if you guess 1 for all observations and 99% if you guess 0. What you want to predict depends on context. Even if guessing 0 leads to more accuracy, getting that one observation that has a value of 1 may be very important (e.g. for example if you are trying to predict cancer). You may want to use sensitivity in this case.

*Explain why it is important to consider context when comparing calculated accuracy in different supervised
machine learning tasks?*
Based on your policy goal, positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives carry different costs. This is why it's good to consider other measures other than accuracy.

are you doing a better job in the second case? not really because it's a better model
relative errors?
